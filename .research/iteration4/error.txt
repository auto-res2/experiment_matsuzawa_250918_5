  × No solution found when resolving dependencies for split (markers:

  ╰─▶ Because pyg-lib was not found in the package registry and your
      project depends on pyg-lib>=0.3.0, we can conclude that your project's
      requirements are unsatisfiable.
      And because your project requires s3-gat-research[dev], we can conclude
      that your project's requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: While the active Python version is 3.11, the resolution failed for
      other Python versions supported by your project. Consider limiting your
      project's supported Python versions using `requires-python`.
